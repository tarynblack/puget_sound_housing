# ESS Graduate Housing Survey

This repository contains the analysis of housing survey responses from graduate students in the Earth and Space Sciences (ESS) department at the University of Washington. This survey is carried out annually by graduate students within the department.

The purpose of the ESS graduate housing survey is 1) to gather information about ESS graduate student housing (location, cost, _etc._), and 2) to provide these data to current and prospective graduate students for informed decision-making about housing.

The survey is organized into several sections:
- Academic demographics
  _(program, cohort)_
- Income
  _(wages, sources, assistance, partners/dependents)_
- Location
  _(city, neighborhood, rating)_
- Costs
  _(rent, utilities, other costs, shared costs, number of people, affordability concern)_
- Characteristics
  _(bedrooms/bathrooms, housing type, facilities, pets, quality)_
- Commute
  _(mode, duration, transfers, have car)_
- Miscellaneous
  _(moving frequency, how to find housing, housing insecurity)_
